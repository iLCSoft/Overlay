## Notes

The Overlay processor can be used to overlay background events from an additonal set of LCIO files in a Marlin job. It requires Marlin v01-00 or higher. For details see ./doc/Overlay.pdf and the doxygen API doc.

The JoinEvents processor can be used to join events on a collection basis, i.e events from an additional input file  are read and all collections are added to the current event (provided they have a name that is different from all collections in the current event).
